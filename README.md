# Fruchtfolge Model

This repo contains the simulation model used in the Fruchtfolge application. The model is written in [GAMS](https://www.gams.com/) language. You need a valid GAMS license in order to run the model.

## Overview

## fruchtfolge.gms

This is the entry point for the model. From this file, all sets, parameters, variables and equations are imported. Also this file needs to be executed when you want to run the model.

## coefficients/

!At the moment, this folder contains all necessary sets and parameters.!

This folder contains all *fixed* model coefficients. These are sets and parameters that are not subject to change by the user. Most often, these will be generalised calculations (and not data) that does not chance depending on the users farm endowments. Examples are the calculation of the median soil quality, the determination of harvest periods etc.

## generated/

The file `generated.gms` contains all model coefficients that are subject to change by the user.
The file will be auto generated by the Fruchtfolge application in the future.

## model/

This folder contains all equations that enter the model.

## Tests

! Not implemented yet!
In order to test the model, execute
```
node test/test.js
```

The `farms` folder contains `generated.gms` files from different test farms. For every farm, a corresponding expected model result needs to be specified in the `results` folder.
